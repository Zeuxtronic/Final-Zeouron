## What can i use it for?
You can use Zeouron for exploiting (on roblox), on the following games:
- Randomly Generated Droids
- Hours
- Robot 64

## How to use
1. Use an executor. If you dont have one, these are some recommended executors:
- Mobile: [Krnl](krnl.cat), [Delta](deltaexploits.gg)
- Desktop: [Swift](getswift.gg)

2. Execute the following code while in a game:
```luau
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zeuxtronic/Zeouron/refs/heads/main/Loader.lua", true))()
```

## Support
If you run into any issues you can tell us in our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/BjrHC26rUP).

Here are some common fixes:

- Not executing:
Most of the time, on krnl, you will need to execute it twice (no idea why)

If that doesnt work, try deleting the folder "Zeouron" in your executors workspace. If you arent using our suggested executors try switching to our suggested executors.
